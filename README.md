# NLP ML Pipeline

End-to-end machine learning pipeline for text classification.

This project covers:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Model training
- Evaluation and error analysis

Tech stack:
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas

The Logistic Regression model achieved strong performance on an imbalanced dataset:

- Spam precision: 0.91
- Spam recall: 0.91
- F1-score: 0.91

Evaluation was performed using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix due to class imbalance.
